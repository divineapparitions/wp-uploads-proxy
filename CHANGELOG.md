## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Uninstall hygiene (issue #10): deleting the plugin now removes all of its own
  persisted state — the settings option, both aggregate counter options
  (downloaded total + Negative-cache size), and every Negative-cache transient —
  on the current site and, on multisite, every site. Downloaded media in the
  uploads directory is deliberately left untouched: a developer uninstalling the
  plugin must never lose media they might still need. Cleanup runs only in the
  genuine uninstall context (`WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN`).
- `Uninstaller` (`src/State/`): the WordPress-free seam behind uninstall. Given
  `delete_option` and the Negative-cache clear as injected collaborators, it
  deletes exactly the three known options and clears the transients. It owns no
  filesystem collaborator, so it cannot delete a file — the "never delete media"
  guarantee is structural, and is fully unit-tested.

### Changed

- `uninstall.php` is now thin glue around the `Uninstaller` seam: it enforces the
  `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` guard, bootstraps the Composer autoloader, iterates every
  site on multisite (`switch_to_blog`/`restore_current_blog`), and delegates the
  cleanup. A self-contained literal-key fallback keeps uninstall robust even when
  `vendor/` has been pruned.
- Integration suite `UninstallTest` (wp-env `tests-cli`, authored-only): drives
  the real `uninstall.php` against WordPress and asserts the options are deleted,
  the transients cleared, downloaded media on disk is preserved, and that
  including the file without `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` defined is a no-op.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Apache-plain-permalinks admin notice (issue #9). Request interception relies on the
  web server routing a missing uploads file to `index.php`. On nginx — the real target
  (DDEV, Lando, Pantheon) — `try_files` always does this; on Apache the `index.php`
  fallback only fires when pretty permalinks are enabled. When the proxy is active on
  Apache with plain (default) permalinks it would silently appear to do nothing, so a
  `manage_options`-gated `admin_notices` warning now explains that pretty permalinks are
  required for interception and points the developer at Settings → Permalinks. nginx
  never sees the notice, nor does a site with pretty permalinks, an inert/unconfigured
  proxy, or a `wp_get_environment_type()` of `production` (the same inert-on-production
  rule as request interception).
- `PermalinkNotice` (`src/Admin/`): the WordPress-free decision seam — given
  is-Apache, has-pretty-permalinks, and is-active it returns whether to show the notice.
  Fully unit-tested (Brain Monkey-free) across the truth table.
- `PermalinkNoticeRenderer` (`src/Admin/`): the thin `admin_notices` glue that reads
  `$GLOBALS['is_apache']`, `get_option( 'permalink_structure' )`, and the resolver's
  active state (gated by an injected environment-type callable, mirroring
  `RequestHandler`), then renders the escaped, translated notice.
- Integration suite `PermalinkNoticeTest` (wp-env `tests-cli`, authored-only): renders
  the notice against real WordPress across the truth table plus the production and
  non-admin gates.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- `wp uploads-proxy` WP-CLI command (issue #8) so setup and reset can be scripted
  in CI without admin clicks. `wp uploads-proxy status` reports the active state,
  the effective Origin, the mode and each value's source (read from the resolver),
  and both counters in a scriptable form (`--format=table|json|yaml|csv`, default
  `table`). `wp uploads-proxy clear-cache` clears every Negative-cache transient and
  resets the downloaded and Negative-cache counters to zero, giving CI a clean slate
  between runs — it never deletes downloaded media from the uploads directory. The
  command registers only when WP-CLI is the runtime (`defined( 'WP_CLI' ) && WP_CLI`),
  so it is inert in a web request.
- `CommandRunner` (`src/Cli/`): the WordPress-free seam the WP-CLI adapter delegates
  to — `status()` reuses the existing `Diagnostics` view-model; `clearCache()` clears
  the Negative cache and resets the counters. Fully unit-tested (Brain Monkey).
- `Counters::reset()`: zeroes both aggregate totals.
- `NegativeCache::clearAll()`: removes the whole `uploads_proxy_neg_*` transient
  family in one query (value rows and their `_transient_timeout_` siblings),
  returning the number of entries cleared. Touches only transients, never media.
- `CountersStore` / `NegativeStore` interfaces (`src/State/`): the narrow surfaces
  the command logic depends on, so it can be unit tested against fakes without the
  WordPress glue.
- Integration suite `CliCommandTest` (wp-env `tests-cli`, authored-only): asserts
  `status()` against real options/resolver and that `clearCache()` clears real
  transients, zeroes the counter options, and leaves a downloaded file on disk.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Diagnostics-first settings page (issue #7): Settings → Uploads Proxy now leads
  with a read-only status panel — active state, the effective Origin and mode each
  labelled with their source (constant / env / DB, read from the resolver), the
  Origin Basic Auth state, and the downloaded-total and Negative-cache counters —
  replacing the scaffold's plain Settings-API form.
- "Test Origin connection" button (Fork A): a `manage_options`-gated,
  nonce-protected `admin_post` handler probes the Origin root (`GET {origin}/`,
  Basic Auth attached) through the existing `OriginRequest`/`OriginClient` seam and
  grades the result **2xx-only as reachable** — every 4xx, 5xx, and transport
  error (status 0) is reported unreachable, with the actual HTTP status shown so a
  developer can tell "HTTP 403" from "no response".
- `OriginProbe` + `ProbeResult` (`src/Admin/`): the WordPress-free probe seam and
  its 2xx-only grading, fully unit-tested.
- `Diagnostics::basicAuthUsername()`: exposes the effective Basic Auth username for
  the read-only label without revealing the password.

### Changed

- Per ADR-0002, each DB field (Origin, mode, Basic Auth) renders editable only when
  no constant/env var overrides it; an overridden field is shown read-only with its
  source. Overridden fields round-trip their stored DB value through hidden inputs
  so saving never wipes a shadowed value.
- Basic Auth password is now **write-only** (Fork B): the real bytes are never
  rendered into the DOM — the status panel shows a fixed mask (`••••••••`) when a
  password is stored and "Not set" otherwise, and the editor offers an empty field
  that only overwrites the stored password when filled in. `Settings::sanitize()`
  now preserves the stored `basic_auth_pass` on an empty submission instead of
  blanking it.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Hotlink mode dispatch (issue #6): when `mode = hotlink`, a Miss issues a `302`
  temporary redirect (never `301`) to the file on the configured Origin with an
  `X-Uploads-Proxy: hotlink` header. Nothing is written locally, so every Miss
  issues a fresh redirect — toggling modes or fixing the Origin is never poisoned
  by permanent browser caching. Download mode remains the default.
- `Responder::serveHotlink( string $location ): void` interface method;
  `HttpResponder` implementation sets `http_response_code(302)`, emits the
  `Location` and `X-Uploads-Proxy: hotlink` headers, then exits.
- Unit tests (Brain Monkey) covering all Hotlink dispatch paths: redirect issued
  to Origin URL, no file written locally, no outbound Origin fetch, and
  confirmation that Download mode remains the default.
- Integration test suite `HotlinkModeTest` (wp-env `tests-cli`) asserting the
  redirect Location, that nothing is written locally, and that no outbound HTTP
  request is made when Hotlink mode is active.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Miss-fallback + Negative-cache deep module (issue #5): Origin `404`/`410` →
  serve a local `404` marked with `X-Uploads-Proxy: negative`, record a
  short-lived Negative-cache transient (~10 min, keyed by the relative uploads
  path via `NegativeCache`) so repeat Misses short-circuit without re-hitting
  the Origin. Origin `5xx`/timeout → serve `404` with no cache entry so the next
  request retries.
- `NegativeCache` (`src/State/NegativeCache.php`): manages `get_transient` /
  `set_transient` with a `uploads_proxy_neg_` + md5 key scheme and a `TTL` of
  600 seconds.
- `Counters::negativeCount()` / `Counters::recordNegative()`: running total of
  Negative-cache entries ever created, stored in the non-autoloaded option
  `uploads_proxy_negative_count`.
- `OriginResponse::isGone()` (404 or 410) and `isServerError()` (5xx or status 0)
  helpers for branching in `RequestHandler`.
- `Responder::serve404( string $xUploadsProxy ): void` interface method;
  `HttpResponder` implementation sets `http_response_code(404)` and the optional
  `X-Uploads-Proxy` header, then exits.
- Unit tests (Brain Monkey) covering all miss-fallback paths: 404 caches + header
  + counter, 5xx does not cache, short-circuit on repeat miss.
- Integration test suite `MissFallbackTest` (wp-env `tests-cli`) asserting the
  full 404/410/5xx/repeat-miss behaviours against real WordPress transients and
  options, with the Origin mocked via `pre_http_request`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Download write-policy hardening (issue #4): `UploadsScope::isAllowedFile()` now
  enforces a two-layer gate — (1) a hard deny on executable extensions (`.php`,
  `.phtml`, `.pht`, `.phar`, `.cgi`, `.pl`, etc.) and (2) a WordPress allowed-MIME
  gate via `wp_check_filetype()` so only file types the site explicitly permits are
  ever written to the uploads directory. A stray unknown extension (e.g. `.bat`,
  `.bin`) that slips through on the Origin returns a local `404` without writing
  anything to disk.
- Unit tests (Brain Monkey) covering the MIME/exec gate: `wp_check_filetype()`
  returning `type=false` prevents both the write and the Origin fetch; executable
  extensions short-circuit before any WordPress call.
- Test documenting path-containment: `absolutePathFor()` with an absolute-path
  input stays within the uploads basedir via `ltrim`, reinforcing the traversal
  protection already in `relativePathFor()`.
- Test documenting host-fixed Origin fetch: `OriginRequest::url()` always uses the
  configured Origin host regardless of path content, so no arbitrary-host SSRF is
  possible.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Request-interception walking skeleton (ADR-0001): on `template_redirect`, a
  Miss for a missing Uploads path is resolved against the configured Origin. In
  Download mode (default) the file is fetched through WordPress's HTTP layer
  (host swapped, relative uploads path preserved, optional Basic Auth attached),
  contained to the uploads basedir with executable extensions refused, streamed
  to a temp file and atomically `rename()`d into place, then served in the same
  request with `Content-Type`/`Content-Length` and an `X-Uploads-Proxy: download`
  header. A downloaded counter tracks the total.
- Deep modules under `src/Proxy/` (`RequestHandler`, `OriginClient`,
  `OriginRequest`/`OriginResponse`, `UploadsScope`, `FileWriter`, `HttpResponder`)
  and `src/State/Counters`. A Derivative and a non-image (PDF) resolve through the
  same handler.
- `@wordpress/env` `tests-cli` integration harness booting real WordPress with the
  Origin mocked via `pre_http_request`, asserting the download/atomic-save/serve
  behaviour, the header, and the file landing on disk.

### Changed

- Pinned PHPUnit to `^9.6` (with `yoast/phpunit-polyfills`) so the WordPress core
  test suite can run under wp-env — the WP test suite is not PHPUnit 10 compatible.

### Removed

- The superseded URL-rewriting `MediaProxy`, replaced by the request-interception
  handler (ADR-0001).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Configuration resolver (deep module) that resolves the Origin, mode, and
  optional Basic Auth in strict precedence order `define()` constant →
  environment variable → DB option → off, and reports the source of each
  effective value for the diagnostics page (ADR-0002).
- `Mode` (`download` default / `hotlink`), `Source`, and `BasicAuth` value
  objects exposed through a typed `EffectiveConfig`, so callers never touch the
  raw option array.

### Changed

- Reshaped the stored DB option from `production_url`/`verify_local` to an
  enabled flag, Origin URL, mode, and Basic Auth credentials — the fallback
  configuration source only. The plugin stays off until an Origin is configured,
  regardless of the enabled flag.
- The scaffold settings page and `MediaProxy` now read effective configuration
  through the resolver instead of the raw option.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Initial plugin scaffold: header, version/PHP guards, and Composer autoloader bootstrap.
- `Settings → Uploads Proxy` admin page (Settings API) for the production origin.
- `MediaProxy` that rewrites attachment, image, and `srcset` URLs to a production
  origin when a file is missing locally, with an optional filesystem check.
- Safety guard that disables proxying on production environments.
- Multisite-aware uninstall cleanup.
- Development tooling: PHP_CodeSniffer (WPCS), PHPStan, PHPUnit (Brain Monkey),
  and a GitHub Actions CI workflow across PHP 8.2–8.4.
